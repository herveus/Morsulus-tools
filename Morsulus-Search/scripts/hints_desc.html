<h2>Armory Description Search Hints</h2>
<p>
Here are some hints for using the 
<a href="XXDescSearchUrlXX">Armory Description Search Form</a>.
<p>
The purpose of the form is to find all registered armory
that matches a particular description, such as
"FIELD DIV.-BENDY:complex line".
It is used, for instance, to view a single category from the
<a href="XXIndexDirUrlXX/index.html">on-line SCA Ordinary</a>.
<p>
Your search will probably
fail if you don't type the description exactly right, so
until a friendlier interface is available, you should probably
access it only through the
<a href="XXIndexDirUrlXX/index.html">on-line SCA Ordinary</a>.
<p>
The form has a text entry field and a "submit" button.
Type the description you are looking for in the box,
then click on the button.
The <a href="XXDescSearchUrlXX">armory description search form</a>
is case-sensitive.
<p>
A <em>description</em> consists of
<ul>
<li>a <em>heading</em> (in all caps), or
<li>a heading followed by one or more <em>features</em>
(in lower-case), all separated by colons.
</ul>
The heading must always appear first, but the features
may appear in any otder after it.
<p>
Here are some typical headings:
<ul>
<li>BORDURE
<li>CHIEF
<li>STAR (includes mullets and compass stars)
<li>PPALE (fields divided "per pale")
<li>PBS (fields divided "per bend sinister")
</ul>
<p>
Here are some typical features:
<ul>
<li>1
<li>2 or more
<li>argent (charges with that coloration;
            divided fields in which the most honorable part is "argent")
<li>complex line (ordinaries and field divisions
                  that are engrailed, embattled, etc.)
<li>multicolor (charges equally divided of several colorations)
<li>sole primary (the only primary charge in the design)
<li>uncharged (charges bearing no tertiary charges)
</ul>
<p>
Here are some examples of reasonable armory descriptions:
<ul>
<li>BIRD:displayed:sable:1
<li>BORDURE:plain line:purpure
<li>PBS:embattled
<li>WAGON
</ul>
<p>
You can also find examples of valid descriptions by enabling the
"Armory descriptions" option on the
<a href="XXBpSearchUrlXX">Blazon Pattern Search Form</a>
and doing a search.
