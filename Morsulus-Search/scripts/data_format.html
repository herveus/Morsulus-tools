</h3><p>
This document describes the format used to record names and armory in
the SCA Armorial Database.  The database is actually a flat text file.
The text is mostly ASCII, with a few Latin-1 encodings.  (Latin-1 is
an extension of ASCII and is an international standard.
Unfortunately, its 8-bit codes are NOT compatible with the "437" code
page normally active on PCs running MS-DOS in the United States.)

<p>
The file consists of a copyright notice followed by records.
<p><h4>

			       NOTICE

</h4><p>
The copyright notice begins with a line that reads "NOTICE:" and ends
with a line that reads "END OF NOTICE."  The records begin immediately
after the end-of-notice.
<p><h4>

			      RECORDS

</h4><p>
Each record occupies a single line in the file, and each line contains
one record.  A record has at least five fields, separated by stiles
('|').  The five required fields are:  name, source, type, text,
and notes, in that order.

<p><ul><li>
  (1)  a name associated with the item
<ul><li>
	  If the type is one of 'B' 'D' 'N' 'a' 'b' 'd' 'g' 'j' 's'
            'BD' 'BN' 'W', or 'D?', this is the registrant's name.
<li>
	  If the type is 'AN', this is the alternate name.
<li>
	  If the type is 'HN', this is the household name.
<li>
	  If the type is 'O', this is the name of the award or order.
<li>
	  If the type is 't', this is the heraldic title.
<li>
	  If the type is one of 'ANC' 'BNC' 'BNc' 'NC' 'Nc'
            'HNC', 'OC', or 'u', this is the earlier name.
<li>
	  If the type is one of 'Bv' 'Bvc' 'v', or 'vc', this is the
            incorrect spelling of the name.
<li>
	  If the type is 'C', this is a blank.
<li>
	  If the type is 'R', this indicates where the cross-reference
            appears in the Armorial.
<li>
	  If the type is 'r', this indicates a word or phrase that is
	        reserved or too generic for registration by itself. 
             

</ul><p>
	  There is no official limit on the length of a name.

<p><li>
  (2)  reference to the source of the information:
<ul><li>
      (a) empty, for items whose source is unknown
<li>
      (b) a six-digit LoAR date (in the form YYYYMM) optionally followed
	  by a kingdom ID letter
<p>
	     Examples:
<p><ul><li>
                '197010'  (= the October 1970 LoAR or errata letter)
<li>
		'199001E' (= the January 1990 LoAR or errata letter under "EAST")
<li>
		'205912W' (= the December 2059 LoAR or errata letter under "WEST")

</ul><p>
	     In this case, the LoAR date indicates the date of the
	     Laurel action that created the record.  For combined
             records (record types 'B' 'BD' and 'D') this is not
             necessarily the date the name was registered, nor
	     is it necessarily the date the armory was registered.
<p><li>
      (c) a dash, followed by an LoAR date, optionally followed by
          a kingdom ID letter
<p>
	     In this case, the item has been released, transfered,
             redesignated, corrected, reblazoned, or is otherwise
             obsolete.  The date is the date of the obsoleting action.
<p><li>
      (d) a pair of LoAR dates, each optionally followed by a kingdom ID,
          the pair separated by a dash
<p>
	     In this case, the item is obsolete.  The second date is
             the obsoleting action, and the first date is the last action
             before the obsoleting action.

<p></ul><p>
      The kingdom ID letters correspond closely to codes used by
      the S.C.A. Registry:
<ul><li>
	  A = Atenveldt
<li>
	  C = Caid

  (4)  text:
<ul><li>
	  If the type is one of 'B' 'D' 'a' 'b' 'd' 'g' 's' 'BD', or 'D?',
            this is the blazon.
<li>
	  If the type is 'BN' 'N', or 'W', this must be empty.
<li>
	  If the type is 'j', this is the name of other registrant of the
            joint badge.  (The other registrant's record will have the
            complete blazon.)
<li>
	  If the type is 'AN', this is 'For' followed by the
	    primary name of the registrant.
<li>
	  If the type is 'HN', this is the name of the registrant, or
            a list of registrants, enclosed in double-quotes and
            separated by 'and'.
<li>
	  If the type is 'O', this is the name of the
	    branch that registered the award or order.
<li>
	  If the type is 't', this is the name of the branch or person
            which registered the title.
<li>
	  If the type is 'BNC', or 'NC', this is the word 'See' followed by
	    the new (branch or personal) name.
<li>
	  If the type is 'ANC' 'HNC', or 'OC' this is the new (alternate,
            household, or award/order) name.
<li>
	  If the type is 'BNc', 'Bv', 'Bvc', 'Nc', 'u', 'v', or 'vc',
            this is the corrected form of the (branch or personal) name.
<li>
	  If the type is 'C', this is the text of the comment.
<li>
	  If the type is 'R', this is the word 'See' followed by
	    the name under which the referenced item appears,
            or a list of names enclosed in double-quotes and separated
            by 'or'.
<li>
      If the type is 'r', this is 'Society for Creative Anachronism'.

</ul><p>
	  There is no official limit on the length of the text field.

<p><li>
  (5)  notes, individually enclosed in parentheses:
<ul><li>
	  To clarify the blazon:
	    'A Cross of Samildanach is four Menorahs in cross'
<li>
	  To indicate the status the item:
	    'Closed' 'Deceased' 'Disbanded' '-released' '-corrected blazon'

</ul><p>
	  There is no official limit on the number of notes or their length.

<p><li>
  (6)  other fields:
<p>
          For name items, there are always exactly four stiles
          (and thus five fields).
<p>

          For armory items (types 'B' 'D' 'a' 'b' 'd' 'g' 's' 'BD' and 'D?')
          additional fields are used to describe the headings under which
          the armory is indexed in the SCA Ordinary.  Obsolete armory
          is not indexed, and there is no official limit on the number
          of headings.
