<h2>Name Pattern Search Hints</h2>
<p>
Here are some hints for using the 
<a href="XXNpSearchUrlXX">Name Pattern Search Form</a>.
The purpose of the form is to find items
associated with a name, even if you don't know the
exact spelling of the name.

<h3>Patterns</h3>
<p>
The first text entry field is where you type the pattern.
The simplest pattern is simply a portion of the name you are
seeking.  For instance, you could type "Peter" in this box
to find all the names containing "Peter".  This would bring up
items such as
<a href="XXNameSearchUrlXX?p=Ulf%20Johannes%20Peter%20von%20Greiffenburg">
Ulf Johannes Peter von Greiffenburg</a>, and even
<a href="XXNameSearchUrlXX?p=Aelfwine%20of%20Peterborough">
Aelfwine of Peterborough</a>.
<p>
You can specify that you want the pattern to appear at the
beginning of the name, by placing a carat (^) in front of the
pattern.  For instance, you could type the pattern "^Peter"
to find all names that begin with "Peter".  This would exclude
the examples above, but would match 
<a href="XXNameSearchUrlXX?p=Peter%20Bentarrow">
Peter Bentarrow</a>, for instance.
<p>
You can specify that you want the pattern to appear at the 
end of the name by placing a dollar-sign ($) after the pattern.
For instance, the pattern "wing$" would match 
<a href="XXNameSearchUrlXX?p=Arthur%20Whitewing">
Arthur Whitewing</a>, for instance.
<p>
Some punctuation marks have special meaning in patterns.
When your pattern includes punctuation marks such as periods (.)
it is a good idea to put a backslash (\) in front of each
punctuation mark.  For instance, to search for names containing
"St." you should use the pattern "St\.".
<p>
If you are unsure of a particular letter in a name, you can use
wild-cards to find it quickly.  For instance, if you are looking
for someone Tatiana, you might use the pattern "Tat.ana" in
case the person you were looking for happened to spell her name
"Tatjana" or "Tatyana"; the period (.) matches any single character.
Alternately, you could use "Tat[ijy]ana".  The portion in
square brackets matches a single character which must be one of the
three listed (i, j, or y).  To specify a wildcard that matches any
character except whitespace, use "\S".
<p>
If there are multiple letters that
you are unsure of, you can use multiple wildcards.  For instance,
"M\S\S\Swood" will match "Mirkwood", "Marewood", and "Muirwood".
If you are unsure of the exact number of wildcards needed, a plus-sign
(+) may be used after any wildcard to indicate repetions.  For instance
"M\S+wood" will match names containing "Mirkwood", "Maplewood",
"Marionwood" and so on.
<p>
You can specify accented characters or ligatures in a "narrow" search
(see below)
by typing a backslash (\) followed by the three-digit
<a href="XXDbSymbolsPageUrlXX">"Oct" code</a>.
For instance, to find "&#198;thelric" you can type the pattern
"\306thelric".
<p>
<h3>Search Types</h3>
<p>
You can specify a name search that is "broad" or "narrow".
A broad search finds all items associated with a name.
A narrow search excludes those items in which the name appears only
as the owner of an order, title, household, or alternate name,
as the target of a cross-reference, name-change, or transfer, or
as the designation or joint holder of a badge.
A broad search often finds more items than a narrow one; since
this may or may not be what you want, both types of search are available.
<p>
Another difference between broad and narrow searches is in their
handling of accented characters and ligatures.  In broad searches
(as in the <a href="XXNameSearchUrlXX">name search form</a>)
non-ASCII symbols are reduced to their nearest ASCII equivalents.
For instance, "&#198;thelric" is treated exactly like "AEthelric".
In narrow searches the "&#198;" is treated as a single character
which matches "\306" but not "A" nor "E".
<p>
You can specify a name search that is "case-sensitive" or
"case-insensitive".  A case-sensitive search differentiates upper-case
and lower-case letters.  For instance, the name pattern "And" would match
"Andrew" but not "Holland".  In case-insensitive search would
treat "A" and "a" as being the same, so that "And" would match both
"Andrew" and "Holland".
<p>
<h3>Maximum Number of Items to Display</h3>
<p>
You can control the size of your search result by typing a number
of items (1-500) in this box.  If you do not fill in the box, at most
25 items will be displayed.  Note that there is a
<a href="XXLimitPageUrlXX">built-in limit</a>
of 500 items, which you cannot override.
<p>
<h3>Display Options</h3>
<p>
You can specify how you want your search results sorted.
Currently there are two options:  by name and by date.
It is usually easiest to find names when they are sorted by name, but
you might want to sort by date if the item
you are looking for is particularly old or particularly recent.
<p>
You can also specify whether you want dates shown in modern style
(Common Era year/A.D.) or SCA style (Anno Societatis).
The SCA calendar counts years from the SCA's "First Tournament"
(1 May 1966) and traditionally uses Roman numerals.
<p>
You can also specify whether you want blazons to be displayed with
links to the heraldic glossary.  These links are helpful if you are
unclear on the meanings of basic blazon terms.
<p>
<h3>Submitting the Search</h3>
<p>
The button at the bottom of the form marked "search for items
matching the name pattern" is used to launch the search.
The server takes no action until you click on the button.
