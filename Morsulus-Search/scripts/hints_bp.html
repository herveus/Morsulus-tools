<h2>Blazon Pattern Search Hints</h2>
<p>
Here are some hints for using the 
<a href="XXBpSearchUrlXX">Blazon Pattern Search Form</a>.
The purpose of the form is to find registered blazons that 
contain particular words or patterns.

<h3>Patterns</h3>
<p>
The first text entry field is where you type the pattern.
The simplest pattern is simply a portion of the blazon you are
seeking.  For instance, you could type "bat" in this box
to find all the blazons containing "bat".  This would bring up not
only blazons containing the word "bat", but also those containing
words such as "batwing", "embattled", "combattant", and "baton".
<p>
You can seach for blazons that contain a particular <em>word</em>
by sandwiching the word between "\b"s.  ("\b" matches any word-boundary.)
For instance, you could type the pattern "\bbat\b"
to find all blazons containing the word "bat"
ignoring words like "combattant" and "bats".
<p>
You can specify that you want the pattern to appear at the
beginning of a word by placing "\b" in front of the
pattern.  For instance, you could type the pattern "\bbat"
to find all items with batons, bats, and batwings, while
ignoring words like "combattant" and "embattled".
<p>
You can specify that you want the pattern to appear at the
beginning of the blazon by placing a carat (^) in front of the
pattern.  For instance, you could type the pattern "^Or"
to find all registered items with fields Or.
<p>
Some punctuation marks have special meaning in patterns.
When your pattern includes punctuation marks such as periods (.),
question marks (?), or parentheses,
it is a good idea to put a backslash (\) in front of each
punctuation mark.  For instance, to search for names containing
"St." you should use the pattern "St\.".
<p>
Some common blazon-terms are not consistently spelled.
For instance, if you are looking for the word "fleur-de-lys",
you might use the pattern "\bfleur-de-l.s\b" to catch both
common spellings of the word (fleur-de-lys, fleur-de-lis);
the period (.) matches any single character.
Alternately, you could use "\bfleur-de-l[iy]s".  The portion in
square brackets matches a single character which must be one of the
two listed (i or y).  To specify a wildcard that matches any
character except whitespace, use "\S".
<p>
If there are multiple letters that
you are unsure of, you can use multiple wildcards.
If you are unsure of the exact number of wildcards needed, a plus-sign
(+) may be used after any wildcard to indicate repetion.  For instance,
the pattern "\bchevron\b.+\bgules\b" matches any blazon that contains
the words "chevron" and "gules" in that order.
<p>
You can specify accented characters (such as the &#234; in v&#234;tu)
by typing a backslash (\) followed by the three-digit
<a href="XXDbSymbolsPageUrlXX">"Oct" code</a>.
For instance, to find "v&#234;tu" you can type the pattern
"v\353tu".
<p>
<h3>Search Types</h3>
<p>
You can specify a name search that is "case-sensitive" or
"case-insensitive".  A case-sensitive search differentiates upper-case
and lower-case letters.  For instance, the pattern "or" would match
"gore" but not "Or".  A case-insensitive search would
treat "O" and "o" as being the same, so that "or" would match both
"gore" and "Or".
<p>
<h3>Maximum Number of Items to Display</h3>
<p>
You can control the size of your search result by typing a number
of items in this box.  If you do not fill in the box, at most
500 items will be displayed.  If more than this number of items match your criteria, you will see a notice linking to <a href="XXLimitPageUrlXX">an explanation of the limit feature</a>.
<p>
<h3>Display Options</h3>
<p>
You can specify how you want your search results sorted.
Currently there are three sort options:  by name, by date, and by blazon.
You might want to sort by date if you know that the item
you are looking for is particularly old.
<p>
You can also specify whether you want dates to be shown in modern style
(Common Era year/A.D.) or SCA style (Anno Societatis).
The SCA calendar counts years from the SCA's "First Tournament"
(1 May 1966) and traditionally uses Roman numerals.
<p>
You can also specify whether you want blazons to be displayed with
links to the heraldic glossary.  These links are helpful if you are
unclear on the meanings of basic blazon terms.
<p>
<h3>Submitting the Search</h3>
<p>
The button at the bottom of the form marked "search for items
matching the blazon pattern" is used to launch the search.
No action is taken by the server until you click on the button.
