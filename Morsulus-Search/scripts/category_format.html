<h2>Format of the Category File</h2>

<p>
The armorial descriptions in the database are stored using codes defined in a text file known as my.cat, which is roughly 128 KB in size. 

<p>
You can download the category file via
HTTP from <a href="XXWebCategoryUrlXX">XXWebCategoryUrlXX</a>

<p>
The category file is divided into three sections, each of which uses a different format:
<ul>
<li> Features (around 350 lines) function as adjectives, such as <code>argent</code> or <code>maltese</code>, providing additional details about a description.</li>
<li> Categories (around 450 lines) function as nouns, such as <code>CROSS</code> or <code>HUMAN FIGURE</code>, providing the core content of a description.</li>
<li> Cross-references (around 2,750 lines) list additional terms which are grouped under another category, such as <code>woman - see human figure</code>.</li>
</ul>

Although the features section of the file appears first in the file, we'll discuss the other two sections first here because categories appear before features when entering search terms.

<h3>
Categories
</h3>

<p>
Categories are the core of armory descriptions. 

<p>
Each category line contains a human-readable term, then a pipe character ("<code>|</code>"), followed by a capitalized category code.

<p>
For example, here are a selection of category lines.

<pre>
axe|AXE
azure field|AZ
beast, bear|BEAST-BEAR
beast, dog|DOG
bird, demi|BIRD9DEMI
bird, whole|BIRD
cross, as charge|CRAC
cross, throughout|CROSS
field division, per fess|PFESS
field division, per pale|PPALE
pole axe|POLE-AXE
</pre>

<p>
As you can see, the category code is sometimes a predictable capitalized version of the human-readable term, and other times is more idiosyncratic.

<p>
Most categories represent types of charges, but some correspond to solid fields or field divisions, and others indicate specific arrangments of charges.

<h3>
Cross-References
</h3>

<p>
Cross-references make it easier to find individual category terms.

<p>
Each cross-reference line contains a human-readable term, then either "<code>see</code>" or "<code>see also</code>", followed by one or more human-readable category names.

<p>
For example, here are a selection of cross-reference lines.

<pre>
axe - see also pole axe
broadaxe - see axe
</pre>

<p>
The <code>see also</code> lines mark places where one category is being linked to another, related category, so in the above example so we can expect to find both <code>axe</code> and <code>pole axe</code> in the category list.

<p>
The <code>see</code> lines mark places where an additional term is being linked to an existing category, so the above example is telling us that there is no <code>broadaxe</code> category and instead all broadaxes are indexed under the <code>axe</code> category.

<p>
Some cross-reference lines direct you to more than one corresponding category, separated by <code>and</code>.

<pre>
bluejay - see bird, whole and bird, demi
swallow - see bird, whole and bird, demi
</pre>

<p>
The above example shows that bluejays and swallows are each indexed in one of two distinct categories, either <code>bird, whole</code> or <code>bird, demi</code>.

<p>
Many of the cross references define varieties, heraldic synonyms, or related charges that are indexed together.

<pre>
alaunt - see beast, dog
cub, wolf - see beast, dog
fox - see beast, dog
husky - see beast, dog
hyena - see beast, dog
talbot - see beast, dog
wolf - see beast, dog
</pre>

<p>
Each of these is either a variety of dog (husky), or an old heraldic term for a variety of dog (alaunt, talbot), or a related canine that is indexed with dogs (fox, hyena, wolf).

<h3>
Features
</h3>

<p>
Features are used to provide additional details about armory descriptions.

<p>
Each feature line starts with a pipe character ("<code>|</code>"), then has a feature set name followed by a colon, and then the individual feature name. 

<p>
For example, the <code>cross_family</code> feature set is used to mark subtypes of crosses. Its contents are defined in a series of lines like the below:
<pre>
|cross_family:crosslet
|cross_family:flory
|cross_family:maltese
</pre>

<p>
The feature name may optionaly be followed by one or more markers showing their relationship to other feature names.

<p>
For example, the <code>tincture</code> feature set is used to mark the coloration of fields or charges. Its contents are defined in a series of lines like the below:

<pre>
|tincture:argent&lt;light
|tincture:ermine&lt;fur&lt;light
|tincture:neutral=multicolor=fur
</pre>

<p>
The first line defines a <code>tincture</code> code named <code>argent</code>, and indicates that it is a subtype of the <code>tincture</code> named <code>light</code>. The second line defines a <code>tincture</code> named <code>ermine</code> and marks it as a subtype of both <code>fur</code> and <code>light</code>. The third line defines a <code>tincture</code> named <code>neutral</code> and marks it as equivalent to both <code>multicolor</code> and <code>fur</code>.

<p>
The subtype relationship defined by the <code>&lt;</code> chracter indicates that the term on the left is a more-specific feature encompased by the term on the right. For example, a search for <code>CROSS:light</code> should also match any armory that is marked as <code>CROSS:argent</code>. However, this relationship is not symatrical; if you search for <code>CROSS:argent</code>, it should not match armory that is marked as <code>CROSS:light</code>.

<p>
The equivalence relationship defined by the <code>=</code> chracter indicates a symetrical relationship between the terms. For example, a search for <code>CROSS:neutral</code> should also match any armory that is marked as <code>CROSS:multicolor</code>, and a search for <code>CROSS:multicolor</code> should also match any armory that is marked as <code>CROSS:neutral</code>.

<p>
Individual armory descriptions may combine multiple features from different feature sets. For example, an Maltese cross throughout argent might be coded as <code>CROSS:maltese:argent</code>

<p>
Individual armory descriptions never use more than one feature from a given feature set. For example, there will never be a cross with two different cross features such as <code>CROSS:crosslet:maltese</code>. 

<p>
Some feature sets are only applicable to certain categories. For example, the features in the <code>bird_posture</code> feature set are only ever used with the <code>BIRD</code> or <code>BIRD9DEMI</code> categories.
