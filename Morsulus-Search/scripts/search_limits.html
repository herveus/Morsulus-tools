<h2>Search Limits</h2>

<p>
The <a href="XXNpSearchUrlXX">name pattern search form</a>,
<a href="XXBpSearchUrlXX">blazon pattern search form</a>,
and <a href="XXComplexSearchUrlXX">complex search form</a>
each allow you to set a limit on the number of returned items.
On these forms, if you do not specify a limit, your results will be limited
to 25 items.

<p>
If your search is limited, you will see a message such as:
<blockquote>
<p>There were <em>n</em> other items for which details are not
available, due to the <a href="XXLimitPageUrlXX">limit feature</a>.
</blockquote>
at the bottom of your results listing.  In this case, the item
you were looking for may be one of the ones that was cut from
the listing.  There are several things you might do next:
<ul>
<li>You can specify a higher limit by filling in the
box next to the words:
<blockquote>
<p>Maximum number of items to return ->;
</blockquote>
and re-running the search.
<li>You can make your search more specific and re-run it.
For instance, if you are doing a
<a href="XXNpSearchUrlXX">name pattern search</a>, you might
try specifying more letters of the name so that
there are fewer matching items.
</ul>
