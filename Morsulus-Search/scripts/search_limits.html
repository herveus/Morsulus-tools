<h2>Search Limits</h2>

<p>
The <a href="XXNpSearchUrlXX">name pattern search form</a>,
<a href="XXBpSearchUrlXX">blazon pattern search form</a>,
and <a href="XXComplexSearchUrlXX">complex search form</a>
each allow you to set a limit on the number of returned items.
On these forms, if you do not specify a limit, your results will be limited
to 500 items.

<p>
If your search is limited, you will see a message at the bottom of your results listing similar to the below:
<blockquote>
<p>There were <em>n</em> other items for which details are not
available, due to the <a href="XXLimitPageUrlXX">limit feature</a>.
</blockquote>
<p>
    In this case, the item
you were looking for may be one of the ones that was cut from
the listing.  There are several things you might do next:
<ul>
<li>You can specify a higher limit by filling in the
box next to the words:
<blockquote>
<p>Maximum number of items to return ->;
</blockquote>
and re-running the search.
<li>You can make your search more specific and re-run it.
For instance, if you are doing a
<a href="XXNpSearchUrlXX">name pattern search</a>, you might
try specifying more letters of the name so that
there are fewer matching items.
</ul>
