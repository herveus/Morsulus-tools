<h2>Date/Kingdom Search Hints</h2>

<p>
Here are some hints for using the 
<a href="XXDateSearchUrlXX">Date/Kingdom Search Form</a>.
The purpose of the form is to find all items
registered during a particular period of time,
through particular kingdoms of the SCA.

<h3>Search Criteria</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Select the inclusive starting and ending dates of the period of interest.
With most browsers, months are selected from a menu, by dragging
with the mouse.  Years are selected by typing the common-era year
(or the last two digits thereof) in the text-entry boxes.
<li>
Select the kingdoms of interest.  With most browsers, kingdoms are
selected (or deselected) by clicking with the mouse on a box
next to the Kingdom's name.
</ol>

<h3>Maximum Number of Items to Display</h3>
<p>
You can control the size of your search result by typing a number
of items in this box.  If you do not fill in the box, at most
500 items will be displayed.  If more than this number of items match your criteria, you will see a notice linking to <a href="XXLimitPageUrlXX">an explanation of the limit feature</a>.
<p>
<h3>Display Options</h3>
<p>
You can specify how you want your search results sorted.
Currently there are two options:  by name and by date.
It is usually easiest to find items when they are sorted by name.
<p>
You can also specify whether you want dates shown in modern style
(Common Era year/A.D.) or SCA style (Anno Societatis).
The SCA calendar counts years from the SCA's "First Tournament"
(1 May 1966) and traditionally uses Roman numerals.
<p>
You can also specify whether you want blazons to be displayed with
links to the heraldic glossary.  These links are helpful if you are
unclear on the meanings of basic blazon terms.
<p>
<h3>Submitting the Search</h3>
<p>
The button at the bottom of the form marked
"search for items matching the dates/kingdoms above"
is used to launch the search.
The server takes no action until you click on the button.
