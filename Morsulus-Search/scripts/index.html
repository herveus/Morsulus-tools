<h2>Search Forms for the SCA Armorial</h2>
<p>
You can find currently-registered armory starting at
the <a href="XXIndexDirUrlXX/index.html">index for the on-line SCA Ordinary</a>.
If you are trying to look armory by its description, or doing conflict
checking, you almost certainly want to start here.

<p>
There are also six search forms available:
<ol>
<li>
A <a href="XXNameSearchUrlXX">Name Search Form</a>
which allows you to search the SCA Armorial database for items
associated with a particular name.  This form is fast and simple,
but not very powerful.  For instance, your search will
fail if you don't type the name exactly right.
<p>
<li>
An <a href="XXDescSearchUrlXX">
Armory Description Search Form</a> which allows you to search for
registered items that appear under a particular heading in the
<a href="XXIndexDirUrlXX/index.html">SCA Ordinary</a>.  This form
is difficult to use because you must know how the headings are
coded in the database.  This difficulty will be corrected
eventually, but for now the 
<a href="XXIndexDirUrlXX/index.html">SCA Ordinary</a> is much
more useful.
<p>
<li>
A <a href="XXNpSearchUrlXX">
Name Pattern Search Form</a> which allows you to search for
items associated with a name, even if you don't know
the exact spelling of the name.  Very useful.
<p>
<li>
A <a href="XXBpSearchUrlXX">
Blazon Pattern Search Form</a> which allows you to search for
blazons containing particular words or text patterns. Please do 
not use this for conflict checking. Use the Ordinary or the Armory
Description Search Form. 
<p>
<li>
A <a href="XXDateSearchUrlXX">
Date/Kingdom Search Form</a> which allows you to search for registrations
during a particular time-period or via a particular kingdom.
NOTE: This form is broken broken broken. Don't bother trying it until it
gets fixed. Watch for this message to go away.
<p>
<li>
A <a href="XXComplexSearchUrlXX">
Complex Search Form</a> which allows you to do sophisticated
searches on the database by combining the results of multiple
searches.  This form is tricky to use, because
there are more things to configure.
<p>
</ol>
<p>
You can also find currently-registered armory using
the <a href="XXIndexDirUrlXX/index.html">on-line SCA Ordinary</a>.
